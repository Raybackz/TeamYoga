        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>The International Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centres is a non-profit organisation founded in 1957 by Swami
             Vishnudevananda and named in honour of his teacher H.H. Sri Swami Sivananda Saraswati Maharaj, one of
              the most influential spiritual teachers of the twentieth century. The Organisation propagates the authentic
               teaching of yoga and vedanta, continuing the lineage of the two great yoga masters, preserving its purity 
               and tradition dating back several thousand years. Their message that the individual must change before the
                world can change is at the core of all yoga. We are a centre for spiritual growth and learning, with many 
                thousands of yoga teachers worldwide trained since 1963.</p>
          <p>The mission is to spread the teachings of classical yoga, integrating the <span>Four Paths of Yoga through the Five
             Points of Yoga</span> of Swami Vishnudevananda into a means to achieve physical, mental and spiritual wellbeing, and
              self-realisation. We uphold the practice of all aspects of the classical teachings of a synthesis of yoga 
              with a strong emphasis on practical experience. Swami Sivananda’s dictum ‘an ounce of practice is worth tons
               of theory’ is strictly followed. Many of the teachers dedicate their lives to the study and practise of yoga
                living within the Organisation as renunciants or swamis.</p>
          <p>With headquarters in Val Morin, Canada, the International Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centres is represented in over
             twenty-six countries with headquarters in Quebec, Canada, and overseen by an executive board of senior disciples
              of Swami Vishnudevananda. In India we have four Ashrams situated at<span>Neyyar Dam (headquarters), Madurai,
               Uttarkashi</span> and <span>Gudur</span> and five Centres—<span>Kailash Colony (New Delhi), Dwarka (New Delhi), Chennai, Madurai</span> and
                <span>Trivandrum</span>. Our Ashrams provide a spiritual retreat to live and study under the guidance of a teacher. Our
                 Centres are an oasis of peace in the midst of the bustle of city life. They provide a calm environment
                  conducive to the study and practice of yoga. Each of the Centres and Ashrams offers the opportunity to
                   learn and practise Swami Sivananda’s Synthesis of Yoga and Swami Vishnudevananda’s Five Points of Yoga.</p>
